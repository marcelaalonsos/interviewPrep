Introduction
- if you want to pass a linked list to a function, you only need to pass a reference to the head node, by accessing the next property of every node, you have access to the full sequential list.
- to traverse through the list, we will need a couple fo variables:
  - current: current node of the linked list we're iterating through
  - look at the next node = current.next
  - we can stop algorithm when current = null
