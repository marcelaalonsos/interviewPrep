Graphs Quiz

1. What data structure is typically well-suited to implement 'visited' in a graph traversal?
- a set because if has O(1) lookup time

2. How is a graph different from a tree?
- a graph may not have a 'root' and there may be multiple paths between 2 nodes. In a tree, there is only a single unique path between 2 nodes.

3. What general algorithm is best suited to find the shortest path between two nodes in a graph?
- breadth-first is best suited because all directions are explored evenly. The first path found via breadthFirst is the shortest path

4. Is an adjacency-list the only way to represent a graph?
- no, graphs representations are diverse. we can have adjacency-lists, edge-lists, grid-graphs, explicit

5. What is the difference between a directed graph and undirected graph?
- in a directed graph, edges can only be traveled in one direction. In an undirected graph, edges can be traveled both ways

6. what data structure in javascript is used to represent a typical adjacency list?
- an object where each node id points to an array of the node's neighbors
