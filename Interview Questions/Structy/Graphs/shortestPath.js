//prompt
/*
Write a function, shortestPath, that takes in an array of edges for an undirected graph and two nodes (nodeA, nodeB). The function should return the length of the shortest path between A and B. Consider the length as the number of edges in the path, not the number of nodes. If there is no path between A and B, then return -1
*/

//approach
/*
breadth-first approach
create an adjacency list from the edges
