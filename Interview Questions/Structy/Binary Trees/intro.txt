Intro to Binary Trees
- You can store numbers, string, and other objects in the nodes
- Parent -> child relationship: relationship between nodes in a Trees
- Root is a node with no Parent
- Leaf is a node that has no children
- Edges are the connections between nodes

A binary tree is a tree that at most has 2 children
- a node in a binary tree could have less than 2 children
- exactly one root
- exactly one path between root and any node
- an empty tree can be considered a binary tree

Every node could be an object - an instance of a class
Nodes store: current value, but also refer to children (node.left, node.right)
