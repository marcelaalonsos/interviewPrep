Basic Hash Maps

Now that we have all the main ingredients for a hash map, let's put them all together.
First, we need some sort of associated data that we're hoping to preserve.
Second, we need an array of a fixed size to insert our data into.
Lastly, we need a hash function that translates the keys of our array into indexes into the array.
The storage location at the index given by a hash is called the hash bucket.

Let’s use the following example for our hash map:

Key: Album Name	Value: Release Year
The Low End Theory	1991
Midnight Marauders	1993
Beats, Rhymes and Life	1996
The Love Movement	1998

Our map here relates to several A Tribe Called Quest studio albums with the year they were produced in. We’ll need an array of at least size 4 to contain all of these elements. And a way to turn each album name into an index into that array.

For each album name, find that album’s hash by performing the following calculation:

hash_value = ((# of lowercase 'a's in album name) + (# of number of lowercase 'e's in album name))

And then take that hash and calculate an array index by performing hash_value mod 4. Following these steps we get the following schema:

Album Name	Hash	Hash mod 4	Release Year
The Low End Theory	2	2	1991
Midnight Marauders	3	3	1993
Beats, Rhymes and Life	5	1	1996
The Love Movement	4	0	1998

First, the key is translated into the hash using our hashing function. Then, our hash map performs modulo arithmetic to turn the hash into an array index.
