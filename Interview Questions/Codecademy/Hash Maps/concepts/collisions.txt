Collisions

Remember hash functions are designed to compress data from a large number of possible keys to a much smaller range. Because of this compression, it’s likely that our hash function might produce the same hash for two different keys. This is known as a hash collision. There are several strategies for resolving hash collisions.

The first strategy we’re going to learn about is called separate chaining. The separate chaining strategy avoids collisions by updating the underlying data structure. Instead of an array of values that are mapped to by hashes, it could be an array of linked lists!

Separate Chaining

A hash map with a linked list separate chaining strategy follows a similar flow to the hash maps that have been described so far. The user wants to assign a value to a key in the map. The hash map takes the key and transforms it into a hash code. The hash code is then converted into an index to an array using the modulus operation. If the value of the array at the hash function’s returned index is empty, a new linked list is created with the value as the first element of the linked list. If a linked list already exists at the address, append the value to the linked list given.

This is effective for hash functions that are particularly good at giving unique indices, so the linked lists never get very long. But in the worst-case scenario, where the hash function gives all keys the same index, lookup performance is only as good as it would be on a linked list. Hash maps are frequently employed because looking up a value (for a given key) is quick. Looking up a value in a linked list is much slower than a perfect, collision-free hash map of the same size. A hash map that uses separate chaining with linked lists but experiences frequent collisions loses one of its most essential features.
