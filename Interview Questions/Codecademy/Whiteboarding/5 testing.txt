Testing with Inputs

With a working implementation on the whiteboard, use the test inputs to walk through the evaluation of your code.

Write out any temporary variables on the board and update them when they change during execution.

This is another opportunity to showcase your communication skills, and will help you catch any logical errors which you may not have noticed in earlier steps.

If you catch an error, donâ€™t panic! Mistakes happen. Explain the issue and talk through what you can do to fix the bug.

Your interviewer may want to see you write the correction or they may be satisfied with the explanation.
