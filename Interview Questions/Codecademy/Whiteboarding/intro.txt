Introduction

Aspiring developers must pass a technical interview to be hired as a professional. These interviews evaluate the candidateâ€™s ability to write code, articulate their thought process, and problem solve in a timed environment.

Technical interviews take many forms: writing code alongside an employee of the company, testing online with a third-party service, take-home challenges spanning several days, and more!

A whiteboarding technical interview requires the interviewee to plan and code the solution by hand. The candidate relies on their ability to communicate without the assistance of a text editor or web browser.

This lesson covers strategies to improve performance in a whiteboarding interview. Each exercise features a step in the interview with a video demonstration of the technique.

The steps are:

1. Clarify the Problem
2. Create Inputs
3. Outline the Solution
4. Code the Solution
5. Test the Solution
6. Analyze the Solution
