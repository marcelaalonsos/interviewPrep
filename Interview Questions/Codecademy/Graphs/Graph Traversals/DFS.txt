Depth-First Search (DFS) Conceptual

Depth-first search algorithms check the values along a path of vertices before moving to anoter path.

While this isn't exactly ideal when you want to find the shortest path between two points, DFS can be very helpful for determining if a path even exists.

In order to accompish this path-finding feat, DFS implementations use either a stack data structure, or more commonly, recursion to keep track of the path the search is on and the current vertex.

In a stack implementation, the most recently added vertex is popped off the stack when the search has reached the end of the path. Meanwhile, in a recursive implementation, the DFS function is recursively called for each connected vertex.
