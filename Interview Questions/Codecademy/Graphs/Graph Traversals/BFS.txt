Breadth-First Search (BFS) Conceptual

BFS checks the values of all neighboring vertices before moving into another level of depth.
This is an incredibly inefficient way to find any path between two points, but it's an excellent way to identify the shortest path between two vertices.
Because of this, BFS is helpful for figuring out directions from one place to another.

Unlike DFS, BFS graph search implementations use a queue data structure to keep track of the current vertex and vertices that still have unvisited neighbors. in BFS search a vertex is dequeued when all neighnoring vertices have been visited.
