Learn Binary Search

With a sorted data-set, we can take advantage of the ordering to perform a search which is more efficient than going element by element.

Binary search requires a sorted data-set. We then take the following steps:
1. check the middle value of the dataset
  2. if this value matches our target we can return the index
3. if the middle value is less than our target
  4. start at step 1 using the right half of the list
5. if the middle value is greater than our target
  6. start at step 1 using the left half of the list.

Eventually, we run out of values in the list or find the target value.

TIME COMPLEXITY OF BINARY SEARCH

How efficient is binary search?
In each iteration, we are cutting the list in half. The time complexity is O(log N).
A sorted list of 64 elements will take at most log2(64) = 6 comparisons.

In the worst case:

- Comparison 1: We look at the middle of all 64 elements

- Comparison 2: If the middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at 32 elements

- Comparison 3: If the new middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at 16 elements

- Comparison 4: If the new middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at 8 elements

- Comparison 5: If the new middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at 4 elements

- Comparison 6: If the new middle is not equal to our search value, we would look at 2 elements

When thereâ€™s 2 elements, the search value is either one or the other, and thus, there is at most 6 comparisons in a sorted list of size 64.
