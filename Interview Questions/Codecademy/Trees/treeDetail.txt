Tree Detail

Trees grow downwards in computer science and a root node is at the very top.
The root node could also be a parent node if it has child nodes.
Children nodes with the same parent node are siblings.
It is common to have nodes act as both parent and child to different nodes within a tree.
When a node has no children, we refer to it as a leaf node.

These terms: root, leaf, child, sibling, and parent give us a precise way to communicate the relationships between nodes.
