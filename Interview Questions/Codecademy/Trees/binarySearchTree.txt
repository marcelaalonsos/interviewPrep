Binary Search Tree

Constraints are placed on the data or node arrangement of a tree to solve difficult problems like efficient search.

A binary tree is a type of tree where each parent can have no more than two children, known as the left child and the right child.

Further Constraints make a binary search tree:
- left child calues must be lesser than their parent
- right child values must be greater than their parent

The constraints of a binary search tree allow us to search the tree efficiently. At each node, we can discard half of the remaining possible values.

Letâ€™s walk through locating the value 31.

1. Start at the root: 39
2. 31 < 39, we move to the left child: 23
3. 23 < 31, we move to the right child: 35
4. 31 < 35, we move to the left child: 31
5. We found the value 31!

In a dataset of fifteen elements, we only made three comparisons.
