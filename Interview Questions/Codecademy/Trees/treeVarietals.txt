Tree Varietals

Trees come in various shapes and sizes depending on the dataset modeled.

Some are wide, with parent nodes referencing many child nodes.

Some are deep, with many parent-child relationships.

Trees can be both wide and deep, but each node will only ever have at most one parent; otherwise, they wouldn’t be trees!

Each time we move from a parent to a child, we’re moving down a level. Depending on the orientation we refer to this as the depth (counting levels down from the root node) or height (counting levels up from a leaf node).
